# StupidGIF

A Windows Batch File to generate animated GIFs from videos using FFmpeg

To use this batch file:
1. Go to the [FFmpeg Windows Releases page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) to download a binary.
2. Place the ```ffmpeg.exe``` binary in the same directory as the batch file. 
3. Drag a video file on top of the batch file to make a GIF!

This script uses several external scripts and resources:
